            <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study exploits Taiwan's unique electoral institution, using recall petitions against Kuomintang legislators as a quasi-natural experiment. Applying a Discontinuity-in-Differences design around the recall qualification threshold, we find that qualifying for a recall vote significantly depresses local housing prices, transaction volumes, and transaction price premiums within three months. Mechanism analysis links this decline to heightened political uncertainty arising from potential recalls, amplified by increased news coverage, adverse household expectations, and localized social protests. Effects are particularly pronounced in areas with dense small and medium enterprises, politically polarized communities, trade-dependent cities, tariff-exposed regions, and communities with strong indigenous or clan networks. Instrumental variable estimations confirm the causal impact of recall-induced political risk, providing micro-empirical evidence on pricing political uncertainty in democratic settings.

    <div class="paper-title">Authoritarianism and the Next Generation: Evidence from Taiwan’s Classroom Randomization</div>
    <div class="paper-abstract">
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Can democratic institutional reforms dismantle the pernicious intergenerational legacies of authoritarian pedagogy? We challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating how authoritarian educational imprints transmit across generations through dual pathways: direct familial socialization and classroom peer effects. Longitudinal evidence reveals that mothers exposed to authoritarian pedagogy transmit disadvantage to their children via two mechanisms: (1) disrupted noncognitive skill formation and (2) emotionally detached parenting practices, resulting in significant declines in children’s academic performance, impaired cognitive development, and increased risk-taking behaviors. Crucially, these children’s presence in classrooms generates negative peer spillovers: their classmates exhibit depressed cognitive abilities and academic achievement, particularly in under-resourced schools, through the deterioration of collective learning environments. The dual transmission mechanism—familial (parent-to-child) and peer-based (child-to-classmate)—consolidates into persistent deficits in educational and occupational trajectories. Our findings necessitate targeted interventions addressing both household dynamics and peer learning ecosystems to disrupt self-perpetuating cycles of inequality.
